# Data-Engineering-Disaster
* This is the analysis project based on Disaster and risk priortization.
* For further  her information we have used "dash" to build Dashboard.
* We have used Impact factor analysis to derive a new factor from the given dataset.
# Intresting build
* Update that It can download a mitigation document template to the file-system to tell us how to when to and why to mitigate this/these disaster first
* It uses FPDF to download a **Document.pdf** file which is the assessment of number of disasters expalined.
## Completed the download file
